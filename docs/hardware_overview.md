## STM8L051F3 MCU

The 8-bit ultra-low power STM8 MCU Core provides increased processing power (up to 16 MIPS at 16 MHz) while maintaining the advantages of a CISC architecture with improved code density, a 24-bit linear addressing space and an optimized architecture for low power operations. It also features embedded data EEPROM and low power, low-voltage, single-supply program Flash memory. The device incorporates an extensive range of enhanced I/Os and peripherals, a 12-bit ADC, a real-time clock, two 16-bit timers, one 8-bit timer, as well as standard communication interfaces such as an SPI, an I<sup>2</sup>C interface, and one USART. For more information, refer to the [datasheet](assets/component_documentation/stm8l051f3-1.pdf).

## TCT40-16R/T

The TCT40-16R and TCT40-16RT are an analog ultrasonic receiver and transmitter featuring a distance range from 0.2 to 18 meters and a beam angle of 80Â°. We've attached an RS232 transceiver to the transmitter to boost the signal being sent out, and the receiver goes through an LMV324 op-amp to clean up the signal coming in for optimum detection. For more information, refer to the translated datasheet [here](assets/component_documentation/TCT40-16-T-R.pdf).

## Qwiic connectors

Our Qwiic Ecosystem makes sensors pretty much plug and play. There are two Qwiic connectors on the side of the Qwiic Distance Sensor board to provide power and I<sup>2</sup>C connectivity simultaneously. The default I<sup>2</sup>C address is 0x2F. The `updateAddress()` function allows you to change the I<sup>2</sup>C address to any address from 0x08 to 0x7F. More information on our Qwiic Ecosystem [can be found here](https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic).

## Power

Ideally, power will be supplied via the Qwiic connectors on either side of the board. Alternatively, power can be supplied through the pins along the bottom side of the board labeled `3V3` and `GND`. The input voltage range should be between <b>1.8</b>-<b>3.6V</b>.

## Trigger and Echo Pins

The Trigger and Echo pins are available as plated through holes to manually calculate the distance using the Ultrasonic Distance Sensor. To use, pull TRIG HIGH and then LOW, wait for the ECHO pin to go HIGH and then take the time in between to calculate the distance to the object. For more information on how this works, check out Example 3 later in this guide.

## Testpoint Pads

We've provided a number of open pads on the back of the board.



### I2C Pads

Should you wish to avoid using the Qwiic connectors, you can use these two pads (along with the power PTH pins) to still take advantage of the I<sup>2</sup>C communication protocols.

### Single Wire Interface Module (SWIM)

SWIM, INT, and NRST are all part of the "Single Wire Interface Module (SWIM)" used for programming the onboard STM8 microcontroller and for most users, can be effectively ignored. For those who wish to dive into the deep end and tweak the firmware, these pads are available. Requirements include ST Visual Develop (the ST Progamming Software bundled with Visual Develop), a COSMIC compiler license, and a USB to SWIM adapter.

### LED Jumper

If you are concerned about power consumption, need to run dark, or you just don't like LEDs, cut the traces here to disconnect the Power LED from, you guessed it, power.

### I<sup>2</sup>C

The Qwiic Ultrasonic Distance Sensor has built-in 2.2k pull-up resistors on the SDA and SCL lines. These are needed for normal I<sup>2</sup>C communication. The I<sup>2</sup>C jumper has two small traces connecting the pull-ups to 3.3V. **For general use you can leave this jumper unmodified.** If you have many (over 7) devices on the I<sup>2</sup>C bus, each with their own pull up resistors, then you may want to [cut the I<sup>2</sup>C jumpers](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-work-with-jumper-pads-and-pcb-traces) to disconnect the 2.2k resistors on each Qwiic board.
