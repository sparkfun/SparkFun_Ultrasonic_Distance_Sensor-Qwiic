Using the Qwiic system, assembling the hardware is simple. Connect the RedBoard to one of the Ultrasonic Distance Sensor Qwiic ports and the Qwiic OLED Display on the other Qwiic port using your Qwiic cables. Then connect the RedBoard to your computer via the MicroUSB cable and voila! You're ready to rock!
