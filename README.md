[*SparkFun Ultrasonic Distance Sensor - TCT40 (Qwiic) (SEN-24805)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/24805)

The SparkFun Qwiic Ultrasonic Distance Sensor, a user-friendly upgrade to the popular HC-SR04 sensor, offers non-contact distance measurement from 2cm to 400cm with an accuracy of 3mm. This sensor is designed to seamlessly integrate with the Qwiic ecosystem for I<sup>2</sup>C communication, making it a breeze to add to your existing projects and daisy-chain with other Qwiic components.

If you prefer to bypass the Qwiic connector and I2C, you can also access the VCC, Trigger, Echo, and Ground pins broken out on the board's edge. Please be aware that this ultrasonic sensor comes uncalibrated, and you will need to manipulate the raw output for your specific application.

With its wide range of applications, the SparkFun Qwiic Ultrasonic Distance Sensor is a versatile tool for robotics projects, obstacle avoidance systems, and any application that requires accurate distance measurement without physical contact. Its adaptability makes it a valuable addition to your toolkit.
