[*SparkFun Ultrasonic Distance Sensor - TCT40 (Qwiic) (SEN-24805)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/24805)

You may be familiar with the classic [HC-SR04 distance sensor](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15569), it is great for providing non-contact distance readings from 2cm to 400cm. The SparkFun Qwiic Ultrasonic Distance Sensor improves on the classic by adding a pair of Qwiic connectors to it, so now you can communicate over I<sup>2</sup>C and daisy chain any other Qwiic product of your choosing. 

If you prefer to bypass the Qwiic connector and I<sup>2</sup>C you can also access the VCC, Trigger, Echo, and Ground pins broken out on the edge of the board. Please be aware that this ultrasonic sensor comes uncalibrated and you will need manipulate the raw output for your specific application.
